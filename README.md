# VR Experience Web Interface â€” Interactive To-Do List App

A modern, responsive web application that enables users to efficiently manage tasks through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface with customizable categorization.

## Features

- **Task Management (CRUD Operations)**
  - Create new tasks with title, description, due date, and priority
  - Read/View tasks in organized categories
  - Update task details and status
  - Delete tasks with confirmation

- **Interactive Drag & Drop**
  - Reorder tasks within categories
  - Move tasks between different categories
  - Smooth animations for enhanced user experience

- **Task Categorization**
  - Default categories (Work, Personal, Urgent)
  - Create custom categories
  - Color-coding for visual organization
  - Category-specific task counts

- **Responsive Design**
  - Desktop-optimized drag-and-drop interface
  - Mobile-friendly touch interactions
  - Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
  - Consistent user experience across devices

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18+ (Core framework)
- TailwindCSS (Styling)
- React DnD (Drag-and-drop functionality)
- React Icons (UI elements)

### Future Backend Extension
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB (Task persistence)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize React project with Vite
   - Configure TailwindCSS
   - Set up project structure
   - Install necessary dependencies

2. **UI Component Development**
   - Create reusable components (Task, Category, Modal)
   - Implement responsive layouts
   - Design task creation/editing forms
   - Build category management interface

3. **State Management**
   - Design task and category data structures
   - Implement React hooks for state management
   - Create context for global state (if needed)
   - Handle task CRUD operations

4. **Drag & Drop Implementation**
   - Set up React DnD
   - Configure drag sources and drop targets
   - Implement task reordering logic
   - Add drag-and-drop animations

5. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Adapt UI for touch interactions
   - Implement responsive breakpoints
   - Test and optimize mobile performance
   - Add touch gestures for task management

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Component rendering tests
- State management logic
- CRUD operation validation
- Drag-and-drop functionality

### Integration Testing
- Component interactions
- State updates across components
- Category-task relationships
- Mobile-desktop consistency

### User Acceptance Testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Responsive design verification
- Touch interaction testing
- Performance benchmarking

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Task Management
- Empty task validation
- Duplicate task prevention
- Category limit handling
- Task deletion confirmation

### Drag & Drop
- Invalid drop targets
- Mid-drag interruptions
- Touch event conflicts
- Network lag during state updates

### UI/UX
- Long task titles/descriptions
- Many tasks in single category
- Empty category states
- Screen size extremes

### Data Persistence (Future)
- Connection failures
- Data synchronization
- Concurrent updates
- Cache management
